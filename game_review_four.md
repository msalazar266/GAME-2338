### Rating
I rate Roll, Die, Go Home 7/10 beans(pre alpha stage).

## Summary
Roll, Die, Go Home or RDGH for short, is a dungeon crawler game that was made with Unity. The orginial name was A Good Day to Die, 
but the developer decided to change the name, because "the old name was too long and unnecessarily clunky to say and remember."
This game was released on July 08, 2018 and is currently the pre alpha development stage.

RDGH involves dice, but used differently as you normally would. A die is used as your head which has the ability to shoot an energy
type projectile and can teleport the character to a spot where it is thrown. The object of the game is to complete the objectives 
shown on screen. An example of these objectives is destroying a certain amount of enemies. As you move through the levels, there
are sign posts the player can read for hints on what to do and to describe the situation at that particular spot.

Movement for RDGH is with mouse and keyboard and uses minimal keys to play. The player uses WASD to move, E is to interact, SPACE 
BAR is to activate a charged shot, I opens the inventory, TAB open the map, ESC pauses the game, the mouse is used to aim and 
look broadly at the pointed direction, left mouse button is to shoot and right mouse button is to throw the head die and 
teleport. I would highly suggest the use of a real mouse if the player is using a laptop.

The graphics for RDGH is a pixel style look and has a very good look to it. The music makes the game more immersive by adding to 
the atmosphere of the dungeon crawling.

## Final Thoughts
The decision to change the name is weird due to the fact that the new name is eighteen characters(including the spaces) and the 
old name is seventeen characters(including spaces). RDGH is a fun game even though it has its bugs, because it's in pre alpha, it's
a game that I can spend hours playing just to complete.
