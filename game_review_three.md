### Rating
I rate this game 8/10 beans.

## Summary
This game is about six vans racing on sixteen different tracks. According to the information on the website, Van Tourisimo is
a "de-make of the old arcade favorite Super Sprint."

The object of the game is simple, win the race! The game allows two players to play together or single player and race against the
cpu. Throughout the race wrenches will randomly pop onto the track, these allow the player to upgrade their acceleration, speed, 
and tires. Nitro also pops onto the track which give the player a boost in speed for a short time. Money will pop onto the track which the player can pick up for extra points. Sometimes there are hazards like cones, mud, oil, and water that must be avoided or 
the player will slow down.

The controls are very simple, for player one the arrow keys are used and for player two the WASD keys are used.

The graphics for Van Tourisimo are like old school arcade game where you can see the pixels easily. The resolution is 320x200 and 
has a total of sixteen colors.

The movement of the player's van, at first, is a little tricky to figure out. I say this because it feel like you have to drift 
until you get the tire's upgrade. After the tire's upgrade, the van has more traction to the track and you don't have to time a 
turn or curve as much as before the upgrade.

## Final Thoughts
I like this game for it's simplicity and the controls which are very simple. It's a fun little game that anyone can play to pass the time and it looks like an old arcade game! The movement is a little challenging, but still awesome with or without upgrades.
