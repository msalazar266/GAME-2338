# Game Testing Concepts - Halo 3

## Details



## Testing Types
Functional Testing - Halo 3's testers used Functional Testing to make sure levels load, player spawns, running work well, jumping 
work well, weapons fire, the ablilty to exit the game, and not being able to get out the level. The majority of this is manual 
testing.

Regression Testing - The testers use Regression Testing when something new is added like a vehicle or jumping in place one 
thousand times for validation.

Integration Testing - Testers use Integration Testing to make sure the UI displays correct colors and multiplayer works accross 
multiple consoles.

Automated Testing - It was mentioned that Xbox Live multiplayer testing was done using Automated Testing because of the vast 
amount of users online.

Artists test by running the game and adding textures, designers test by adding a vehicle or tweaking one, sound engineers test by 
tweaking the audio. A dedicated test team begins on day one and works until the end. About three years of testing and a few 
weeks testing outside the company is done overall.


## Game Specific Testing Types
Usability Testing - Psychologist observe players individually to figure out their experience, what they like or dislike, and what 
irritates them.

Playtesting - This is like the Usability Testing done, but many players play the game so the testers get a broader sample compared 
to one.
