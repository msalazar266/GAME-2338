**Question:** During your playtesting where the rules of the game understandable? If not, what was not clear.
> _Answer:_ The rules were not understanding when first beginning. After a few minutes you kind of understand what is going on, 
             but I think this is how it's meant to be.

**Question:** During gameplay did you notice anything that shouldn't be in the game or could be removed and it wouldn't effect game play?
> _Answer:_ I did not notice anything that shouldn't be in the game. Everything serves a good purpose.

**Question:** Is this game balanced? If not, what is the target audience for this game based on that imbalance?
> _Answer:_ The Forest is a balanced game. The enemies are an even match for the player and the survial aspects are not so much to 
             the point where you are not constantly trying to "survive."

**Question:** Does the timing of this game appear to be about right for this type of game?
> _Answer:_ When I bought the game during alpha, in 2014, there wasn't much attention to it. Over the years it has grown to what it 
            is today and the timing of the full release in 2018 great since it was on Steam's front page.

**Question:** During gameplay did the mechanics and theme go together and reinforce each other?
> _Answer:_ The mechanics and theme go well together. It's a survival horror game and the environments with the survial horror 
             theme reinforce each other. 

**Question:** Did you have fun playing this game?
> _Answer:_ I had a lot of fun playing this game, because I love survival and horror games!

**Question:** During gameplay what problems or issues seemed to happen and how did you get them to reoccur?
> _Answer:_ I did not notice any problems or issues with the final release. When I first purchased it, of course there was a lot 
            of issues since it was in alpha. Endnight Games did a great job fixing the issues and problems.
