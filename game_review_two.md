### Rating
I rate Doom(2016) 10/10 beans.

## Summary
This game is about the space marine known as the Doomguy who is posted on Mars for assaulting a superior officer. He works 
alongside the Union Aerospace Corporation as they work on interdimensional travel. Everything goes bad when an invasion from hell 
breaks through and overruns the facilities. The Doomguy is supposed to be the player as they go through the levels with great speed 
and with an arsenal of weapons to mow down demons as they get in the way. The objective is pretty straight forward and that is you 
must destroy every demon in the path to get to Mars's moons Phobos and Deimos, so you can stop the invasion. There are three 
episodes and a fourth added later in Ultimate Doom, for a total of 33 levels.

## Final Thoughts
This game is a classic that helped bring about first person shooters. Doom is an excellent game that every gamer should play at 
least once. The first time playing Doom as a kid was mind blowing for me and ever since then I fell in love with the franchise. I consider this game one of the greatest of all time.
