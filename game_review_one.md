### Rating
I rate Fallout 76 9/10 beans.

## Summary
This game is about a vault dweller in the year 2102 after the Great War which resulted in the world being nuked. The player is 
tasked with repopulating the region called Appalachia in West Virgina while fighting off mutated creatures in an irradiated 
wasteland. The game has six areas to explore and they're called The Forest, Toxic Valley, Ash Heap, Savage Divide, The Mire, and 
Cranberry Bog.

Fallout 76 has an extensive system to create a vast amount of items and structures to help the player. There is 
junk that the player can collect and scrap to make these items and structures. There are animals and crops in the game that the 
player can harvest to create consumables. There are specific locations throughout the map where the player can farm resources, 
consumables, and even ammunition. Power to these locations depend on repairing the region's power station.

Leveling up in Fallout 76 is very fun, because you can gain experience points by creating something, destroying enemies, 
participating in area events, and of course completing missions. This game has some survial features that the player must keep 
an eye on to make sure that their character eats food and drinks water. The player has the opportunity to have a personal store 
where they can sell things and go to another player's store to buy something.

The main enemies are called The Scorched who are mutated people or creatures with crystals, called ultracite, growing out of them. 
The most feared one of the enemies are called Scorchbeasts which are mutated bats created in some way that I will not say for the 
people that have not played it...*cough* humans *cough*...

## Final Thoughts
This is the first online game for the Fallout franchise that had a vast amount of technical issues and had many bad reviews
when it first came out. Before its release, Bethesda wanted the players to act as testers for them and over time Bethesda has 
fixed the issues and added new content to improve the game. I like this game a lot, because I feel that you can create your own 
story while still going through the storyline. The amount of items, enemies, and locations is so much that you can be entertained 
for a very long time!
