I rate this game 10/10 beans.

## Summary
The Resident Evil series of games are well known especially the first one titled Resident Evil. This will be about the 2002 remake 
for the Gamecube. Resident Evil is an amazing game and it helped me realize that I love horror games.

Resident Evil is about a team, named STARS Alpha Team, who was sent to investigate what happened to Bravo Team. Bravo's helocopter is found and Alpha is attacked by zombie dogs which forces them to take shelter in an old mansion almost in the middle of nowhere. Only a few members survive and decide to split up, this is where the game starts. The player is able to play as Jill Valentine or Chris Redfield, choosing Jill will make the game easier and vice versa. As the player uncovers the secrets of the mansion the character realizes that a massive company called Umbrella is behind the zombie abominations. The areas include the mansion, the residence hall, an aqua ring, some underground caves, and the laboratory. Inside the aqua ring is is giant zombie shark called Neptune which the player must defeat.

Movement is odd and so are the fixed camera angles, but that's what helped make it iconic. It's a survial horror game and the 
player must conserve ammo and health items for the later parts of the game. It is possible to destroy all the enemies, but the 
player will most likely die with the final boss codename T-001 Tyrant. Aimming with any weapons is also a little difficult since the player only has three positions to aim; straight, angled up, and angled down. It's very possible that someone can master the controls and movements to the point where it the character moves fluidly.

There are puzzles throughout the entire game that the player must solve to continue forward. These puzzles also made Resident 
Evil iconic, because they were difficult. Important items are scattered throughout the game and the player doesn't really know 
where to go. It's more like exploring the area and looking for clues and items key to the game. 

## Final Thoughts
Resident Evil is a game I think every gamer should play at least once to experience why it is a very succesful series. It even has scenes that make players jump, it's that great of a game. Resident Evil helped revive the zombie genre and sparked many games and movies to be made. This game is considers one of the greatest games of all time and when someone plays it, they will 
see why.
