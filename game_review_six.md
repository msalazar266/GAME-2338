### Rating
I rate this game 10/10 beans.

## Summary
The Resident Evil series of games are well known especially the first one titled Resident Evil. This will be about the 2002 remake 
for the Gamecube. Resident Evil is an amazing game and it helped me realize that I love horror games.

Resident Evil is about a team, named STARS Alpha Team, who was sent to investigate what happened to Bravo Team. Bravo's helocopter 
is found and Alpha is attacked by zombie dogs which forces them to take shelter in an old mansion almost in the middle of nowhere. 
Only a few members survive and decide to split up, this is where the game starts. The player is able to play as Jill Valentine or 
Chris Redfield, choosing Jill will make the game easier and vice versa. As the player uncovers the secrets of the mansion the 
character realizes that a massive company called Umbrella is behind the zombie abominations. The areas include the mansion, the 
residence hall, an aqua ring, some underground caves, and the laboratory. Inside the aqua ring is is giant zombie shark called 
Neptune which the player must defeat.

Movement is odd and so are the fixed camera angles, but that's what helped make it iconic. It's a survial horror game and the 
player must conserve ammo and health items for the later parts of the game. It is possible to destroy all the enemies, but the 
player will most likely die with the final boss called the T00-1 Tyrant.

This game is about... this should be at least 3-4 paragraphs summarising the gameplay mechanics of the game. You should be 
answering the who, what, when, where, why, and how of the game itself.

## Final Thoughts
Resident Evil is a game I think every gamer should play at least once to experience why it is a very succesful series. 
I like this about the game but didn't like this particular feature. This should be at a minimum of one paragraph.
